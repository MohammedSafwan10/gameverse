Let me help you prepare for your viva with detailed, easy-to-understand explanations of potential questions and answers:

1. **Basic Project Overview Questions:**

Q: "Tell us about your project GameVerse."
A: "GameVerse is a comprehensive mobile gaming platform I built using Flutter. It's like having an arcade in your pocket! The app features multiple game categories like classic board games, word games, and reaction games. What makes it special is that users can play both offline by themselves or with friends, and online with other players. We focused on making it user-friendly with a clean design and smooth animations."

Q: "Why did you choose this project?"
A: "I chose to build a gaming platform because:
- Games are something everyone enjoys, making it relatable
- It allowed me to learn many important programming concepts like state management, animations, and multiplayer features
- Each game presented unique challenges in logic and design

2. **Technical Questions:**

Q: "What technologies and tools did you use?"
A: "Let me break down our main technologies:
- Flutter for building the app - it lets us create beautiful apps for both Android and iOS
- GetX for managing the app's state - think of it like a smart manager that keeps track of everything happening in the app
- Firebase for online features - it handles user accounts and lets players play together online
- Local storage for saving game progress - so players don't lose their scores when they close the app
- Custom animations for smooth gameplay - makes everything feel nice and responsive"

Q: "How does your state management work?"
A: "Let me explain with a simple example using our Tic Tac Toe game:
- We use something called GetX to manage game states
- Think of it like a smart notepad that keeps track of:
  * Who's turn it is (X or O)
  * What moves have been made
  * Whether someone has won
  * The game settings like sound on/off
- When a player makes a move, we update this 'notepad' and the screen automatically shows the changes
