- Firebase for backend services (planned)
- Custom animation systems
- Local storage for game states
- Audio services for sound effects and music

*Q: How did you structure your project architecture?*
A: We followed a clean, modular architecture:
```
lib/
  ├── games/              # Game categories and implementations
  ├── core/               # Core utilities and shared components
  ├── screens/            # Main app screens
  ├── services/           # Shared services (audio, storage)
  ├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
  └── models/             # Data models and state classes
```

**2. Technical Implementation**

*Q: Explain your state management approach in detail.*
A: We chose GetX for state management because:
- Reactive state updates using `.obs` variables
- Clean separation of business logic with controllers
- Built-in dependency injection
- Efficient memory management
- Simple syntax and less boilerplate code

Example from our code:
```dart
class GameController extends GetxController {
  final isPlaying = false.obs;
  final score = 0.obs;
  final lives = 3.obs;
  
  void updateScore(int points) {
    score.value += points;
    if (score.value > highScore.value) {
      highScore.value = score.value;
    }
  }
}
```

*Q: How did you handle data persistence across the app?*
A: We implemented data persistence through:
- GetStorage for local storage
- JSON serialization for game states
- Structured data models for consistency
- Error handling for data operations
- Automatic state recovery

**3. Design Patterns**

4. Factory Pattern
   - Game initialization
   - UI component creation

**4. Performance Optimization**

*Q: How did you ensure optimal performance across different devices?*
A: We implemented several optimization strategies:
1. Frame Rate Management
   ```dart
   void updateGame() {
     final now = DateTime.now();
     final dt = (now.difference(lastFrameTime!).inMicroseconds / 1000000)
         .clamp(0, 0.016);
     // Use dt for smooth animations
   }
   ```

2. Memory Management
