ooking at the current categories and games in your app, I can analyze what's already set up and suggest what to build next.
Current Categories:
Classic Board (Active with Tic Tac Toe)
Brain Training
Puzzle
Quick Casual
Word Games
Strategy
Reaction
Educational
Currently Implemented:
Only Tic Tac Toe in Classic Board category
Suggested Next Steps:
1. Classic Board Category (Since you've already started here):
Connect Four (already listed but not implemented)
Chess (already listed but not implemented)
Checkers
Quick Casual would be a good next category because:
These games are typically simpler to implement
High replay value
Popular with users
Suggested games:
Snake
Flappy Bird clone
2048
Puzzle Category would be next because:
Can reuse some logic from other games
Engaging for users
Good for brain training
Suggested games:
Sliding Puzzle
Match-3 Game
Color Fill
My recommendation would be to:
Complete the Classic Board category first by implementing Connect Four, as it:
Shares similar grid-based logic with Tic Tac Toe
Has straightforward rules
Can reuse some of your existing UI components
Is popular and well-known
Would you like me to help you implement any of these suggestions?
